# Matrix-Representation-of-Graph
-Applied matrix algebra to study the structural properties of graphs from an algebraic point of view
-Explored the use of matrix as a possible data structure for representing graph: Adjacency Matrix, Incidence
Matrix
–Studied random walks on directed weighted graphs: Markov chains, absorbing Markov Chains and used the
properties of matrix to simplify the situations.
–Extended the random walks on undirected, unweighted networks, and achieved a much better runtime using
eﬀicient Matrix exponentiation
